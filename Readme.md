# 🛠️ Software Development Issues and Solutions Repository

Welcome to the **Software Development Issues and Solutions Repository**! This repo serves as a hub for collecting, discussing, and resolving common software development issues, as well as suggesting new features and enhancements. Whether you’re encountering errors in Django, React, Next.js, or any other technology stack, this repository aims to provide a comprehensive collection of problems and their solutions, along with feature requests and examples.

## 📖 Overview

In this repository, you’ll find a wide range of **software issues** and **solutions** related to:

- **Frontend Development** (e.g., React, Next.js, TailwindCSS)
- **Backend Development** (e.g., Django, Node.js)
- **Full-Stack Development** (e.g., Monorepo setups, Turbo repo issues)
- **Feature Requests** (e.g., Curved div containers, specific design patterns)
- **Performance Optimizations** (e.g., Next.js core web vitals)
  
Each issue is well-documented and includes:

- **Error Message** or **Feature Request**
- **Detailed Solution or Workaround**
- **Code Examples** (if applicable)
- **Explanations** to help you understand the root cause and the resolution

## 📁 Structure

The repository is organized by categories for easy navigation. Here's how the structure looks:

```plaintext
├── frontend/
│   ├── react/
│   └── nextjs/
├── backend/
│   ├── django/
│   └── nodejs/
├── full-stack/
│   ├── turborepo/
│   └── monorepo/
└── feature-requests/
    ├── design-patterns/
    └── ui-components/
```

Each directory contains issues, solutions, and feature requests related to the specified category.

## 💡 Example: Parsing Error in Turbo Repo (Next.js + ESLint)

**Issue:**

```plaintext
Parsing error: Cannot read file '/users/yakkshit/downloads/project/lingo/my-turborepo/tsconfig.json'.eslint
```

**Solution 1:** Add the following line to `.eslintrc.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
  extends: ["@repo/eslint-config/react.js", "next/core-web-vitals"],
};
```

**Solution 2:** For a global package fix, use:

```js
module.exports = {
  extends: [
    ...[
      "@vercel/style-guide/eslint/node",
      "@vercel/style-guide/eslint/typescript",
      "@vercel/style-guide/eslint/browser",
      "@vercel/style-guide/eslint/react",
      "@vercel/style-guide/eslint/next",
    ].map(require.resolve),
    "turbo",
    "next/core-web-vitals"
  ],
};
```

By implementing this, you can resolve ESLint parsing errors in a **monorepo** setup with Turbo repo.

### Example: Add Curves to a `div` Container

**Feature Request:**

How can we add smooth curves to a `div` container for a design requirement?

**Solution:**

Use the following CSS code to create curves in the `div`:

```css
.curved-div {
  border-radius: 50px 50px 0 0;
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
}
```

This will create a smooth curve at the top of your container, and you can adjust the `border-radius` values as per your design needs.
